## Minimize scope to the actual problem

When user asks to fix "X", implement only X. Don't add defensive features for edge cases they didn't mention.

**Example:** user asked to "update document.title on client-side navigation". First attempt added:
- `FALLBACK_TAG_NAMES` + `getReactTypeName()` (module-federation edge case — never asked for)
- Eager `getHeadSnapshot()` replacing the existing `CollectedHead` architecture
- Tree walking with `flattenText`/`extractTitleText` helpers

User response: "This looks like an over-engineered mess." Correct reaction — the actual fix is ~15 lines.

## RSC head store architecture in spiceflow

`spiceflow/src/react/head.tsx` uses `React.cache(() => ({ tags: [] }))` for per-request isolation.

Render order guarantees:

```
layouts/page render  →  <Head> runs  →  pushes into getHeadStore().tags
                                                      │
                                                      ▼
                                             CollectedHead renders LAST
                                             (placed in FlightData.head)
                                                      │
                                                      ▼
                                             reads store, emits <title>...<meta>
```

This means **any server component placed alongside `CollectedHead`** can also read
the populated store. No need for a second tree walk or parallel mechanism.

To add title-updating on client navigation: extend `CollectedHead` to also render a
`'use client'` component with the title string. That component does
`useEffect(() => { document.title = title }, [title])`. Reuses the same store.

## Don't replicate machinery when a store already exists

If data is already collected somewhere (via `React.cache`, context, etc), consume
it from its existing storage instead of walking trees or adding parallel state.

## Keep generated READMEs in sync

After editing root `README.md`, regenerate the three downstream copies:

```bash
echo '<!-- DO NOT EDIT: This file is auto-generated from root README.md -->' > ./spiceflow/README.md
echo '' >> ./spiceflow/README.md
cat ./README.md >> ./spiceflow/README.md
cp ./README.md ./website/app/readme.mdx
cp ./README.md ./website/public/readme.md
```

The three generated files are gitignored, so they don't show in `git status`.

## Vite 8 optimizeDeps: `+` bug with pnpm scoped packages

**Symptom:** dev server crashes on startup with

```
TypeError: Cannot destructure property 'exportsData' of
           'depForEntryFileName[chunk.fileName]' as it is undefined.
    at ...vite/dist/node/chunks/node.js:31312:14
```

**Cause:** pnpm stores scoped packages in `.pnpm/@scope+pkg@version/` directories —
`+` is pnpm's scope separator. Vite's `flattenId` does NOT escape `+`, but rolldown
replaces `+` with `_` in chunk filenames. So if `optimizeDeps.include` contains an
absolute path like `.pnpm/@vitejs+plugin-rsc@.../.../file.js`, the key in
`depForEntryFileName` has `+` but the chunk filename has `_` → mismatch → crash.

**Debug technique:** patch node_modules vite to log the missing chunk:

```js
if (!depForEntryFileName[chunk.fileName]) {
  console.error('[DEBUG] missing:', chunk.fileName, 'keys:', Object.keys(depForEntryFileName))
}
```

**Fix approaches:**
1. Use `'spiceflow > dep'` nested-id syntax — Vite's `nestedResolveBasedir` already
   respects `preserveSymlinks` so pnpm `+` paths aren't produced. Simplest. Downside:
   requires spiceflow to be resolvable from the project root (breaks wrapper-plugin
   nesting like `@holocron.so/vite` → spiceflow).
2. Wrapper plugins can prefix: `'holocron > spiceflow > dep'` when spiceflow
   is nested. Wrapper knows its own name.
3. Use `tryResolve` + post-process `.pnpm/.../node_modules/` segment to get the
   symlinked path (our previous fix, now reverted for simplicity).

**Upstream:** this is a Vite/rolldown bug. `flattenId` should escape `+` or
rolldown shouldn't normalize it.

## Wrapper plugin architecture

`@holocron.so/vite` (at ~/Documents/GitHub/holocron) wraps spiceflow and bundles
it as a transitive dep. When wrapper plugins use spiceflow's
`optimizeDeps.include` entries, they need to rewrite `'spiceflow > X'` to
`'<wrapper-name> > spiceflow > X'` so Vite can resolve them from the consumer's
project root (where only the wrapper is installed, not spiceflow directly).

**Shipped pattern:** a small plugin that runs AFTER `spiceflowPlugin` and maps
entries. Lives in `holocron/vite/src/vite-plugin.ts` as
`rewriteSpiceflowNestedIds` (commit `7aff1049` in holocron,
`aebee8d` in spiceflow).

```ts
const rewriteSpiceflowNestedIds: Plugin = {
  name: 'holocron:rewrite-spiceflow-nested-ids',
  configEnvironment(_name, config) {
    if (!config.optimizeDeps?.include) return
    config.optimizeDeps.include = (
      config.optimizeDeps.include as string[]
    ).map((entry) =>
      typeof entry === 'string' && entry.startsWith('spiceflow >')
        ? `@holocron.so/vite > ${entry}`
        : entry,
    )
  },
}
```

Plugin order in the returned array matters — spiceflowPlugin must come first
so its `'spiceflow > X'` entries are already present when we rewrite.

## CollectedHead: derive DocumentTitle from deduped tags, not reversed.find

`CollectedHead` in `spiceflow/src/react/head.tsx` used to pick the title in two
independent ways: the SSR `<title>` went through `getProcessedHeadTagElements`
(Map-based dedup, last `.set()` wins), while `DocumentTitle`'s `title` prop came
from `reversed.find((t) => t.type === 'title')` (first match wins). For input
store `[page, layout]` those two code paths disagree: the Map picks `page`
(layout set first, then page overwrites), the `find` picks `layout` (first in
the reversed array). Result: SSR HTML shows `<title>Page title</title>`, then
hydration runs `DocumentTitle.useEffect` which sets `document.title = "Layout
title"` and the tab silently flips.

Fix: call `getProcessedHeadTagElements` first, then read the title from the
deduped output via `processedTags.find((t) => t.type === 'title')`. One source
of truth, so SSR and client stay in sync regardless of push order.

Testing lesson: `toHaveTitle` retry assertions can give false positives for
race conditions — they pass as soon as the title matches once. To catch
hydration overrides, first wait for a post-hydration signal (e.g.
`layout-mount-count` going from 0 to 1) and then assert with a plain `expect`.

## React.cache() dual instance: use resolve.dedupe, not custom dispatchers

`@vitejs/plugin-rsc` vendors `react-server-dom-webpack` as CJS files that do
`require("react")`. Under pnpm's strict module isolation, this `require` can
resolve to a different React instance than user code's `import React from 'react'`.
The vendor's `renderToReadableStream` sets `ReactSharedInternals.A` (cache dispatcher)
on its React, but user code reads `A` from a different instance → `React.cache()`
returns fresh objects every call → Head/CollectedHead tag collection breaks.

**Fix:** `resolve.dedupe: ['react', 'react-dom', ...]` in RSC and SSR environments.
This forces Vite to resolve all React imports from the project root regardless of
where the importer lives. One line in `configEnvironment`, no custom dispatchers needed.

**Wrong fix:** Custom `AsyncLocalStorage`-backed cache dispatcher wired into
`ReactSharedInternals.A` (commit `eb96e01`). Works but reimplements React internals
and doesn't address the root cause.

## Git safety

During this session I tried to revert a recently-committed local change and
got blocked by the instruction "NEVER rewrite git history / amend unless
asked". Correct response: add a new follow-up commit that undoes/redoes, do
not reset/amend. That's what `aebee8d` does on top of `7cdae0c`.

## Federation stream cancellation

Federated RSC streaming needs cancellation wired through both layers: the outer SSE `Response` stream and the inner Flight stream/parser. If either side lacks `cancel()`/`return()` cleanup, aborted decodes keep reading in the background and streaming fixes look correct in happy-path tests while still leaking work.

## Standalone test isolation

`test-e2e-start` runs the built server from the app root, so Node can still fall back to source `node_modules` and hide missing `dist/node_modules` files. For standalone tracing regressions, copy `dist/` into a temp directory and boot `node dist/rsc/index.js` there so resolution only sees traced output.

## Returned page responses

If a `.page()` or `.layout()` handler returns a `Response`, never place that object directly into `FlightData` (`page`/`layouts`) or React RSC serialization crashes with `Only plain objects... {page: Response}`. Redirect `Response`s should short-circuit out of `renderReact()` as raw HTTP responses; non-redirect `Response`s should be turned into `<ThrowResponse>` so browser/client navigation still goes through the existing notFound/error boundary flow.
